# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Awesome Mongol Script! Please read through these guidelines before submitting your contribution.

## Adding to the List

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

### Eligibility Requirements

- **Open Source Only**: Only open-source (OSS) and free/libre open-source (FLOSS) projects are accepted
  - The project must have an OSI-approved license (MIT, Apache, GPL, BSD, etc.)
  - Proprietary or closed-source software will not be accepted
- **Related to Mongolian Script**: The project must be directly related to Traditional Mongolian Script (ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ᠌)
- **Functional**: The project should be working and maintained (or of significant historical/educational value)
- **Quality**: The project should be of good quality and provide value to users

### Formatting Guidelines

- Use the following format: `[Project Name](link) - Description.`
- The link should be the direct link to the project repository or official website
- Keep descriptions clear, concise, and objective
- Start descriptions with a capital letter and end with a period
- Don't start the description with "A" or "An"
- Check your spelling and grammar
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome

### Pull Request Process

1. Search previous suggestions before making a new one to avoid duplicates
2. Make an individual pull request for each suggestion
3. Use the pull request template provided
4. Add your link to the appropriate category, maintaining alphabetical order within categories
5. Add a title and description explaining why the project is awesome
6. Make sure the tests pass (links are valid, formatting is correct)

### Multilingual Support

This repository maintains README files in multiple languages:
- [README.md](README.md) - English (main)
- [README_mn.md](README_mn.md) - Mongolian (Cyrillic)
- [README_kk.md](README_kk.md) - Kazakh
- [README_ru.md](README_ru.md) - Russian
- [README_mn_script.md](README_mn_script.md) - Mongolian Script

**Required:** When adding new entries, you MUST update at least [README.md](README.md) (English).

**Recommended:** It is highly encouraged to also update the other language versions to keep all documentation in sync. If you're not comfortable translating to all languages, that's okay - you can:
- Update only the languages you're fluent in
- Open a separate issue using the "Translation Request" template for the remaining languages
- Other community members can help with translations later

Translations help make this resource accessible to more people in the Mongolian-speaking community!

**How to request translations:** If you've added content but need help translating it to other languages, please [open a Translation Request issue](../../issues/new?template=translation_request.md) after your PR is merged.

### Quality Standards

Your contribution should meet these quality standards:

- The project should have clear documentation
- The project should have a proper README explaining what it does
- Links should point to the source repository when possible (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Prefer active projects, but historically significant unmaintained projects may be included with a note

## Updating Your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer will ask you to edit your pull request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the guidelines.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a broken link or outdated information, please open an issue or submit a pull request to fix it.
