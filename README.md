## What is Traditional Mongolian Script?

Traditional Mongolian Script (ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ᠌, Mongol bichig) is the classical and traditional writing system of the Mongolic languages. It has a history spanning over 800 years and is one of the few vertical scripts still in use today. The script is written vertically from top to bottom in columns that advance from left to right.

Today, Traditional Mongolian Script is:
- The official script of Inner Mongolia (China)
- Experiencing a revival in Mongolia, where it's being reintroduced alongside Cyrillic
- Used by Mongolian communities worldwide to preserve cultural heritage
- Supported in Unicode (U+1800–U+18AF) and modern digital systems
